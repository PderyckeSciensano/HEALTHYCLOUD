# Open Notebook produced by [HealthyCloud.eu](https://healthycloud.eu).

This FAIRness evaluation tool has been created by members of the <A HREF="https://healthycloud.eu/" TARGET="_blank">HealthyCloud consortium</A>, specifically Work Package 3 (WP3). The tool is based on the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) <A HREF="https://ardc.edu.au/resources/aboutdata/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/" TARGET=_blank>FAIR data self-assessment tool.

This 2-in-1 tool (survey form and reporting) is designed to allow assessment of the FAIRness of health-related data infrastructures, and includes questions to assess each of the FAIR principles. These questions are based on a survey developed by members of the consortium with the aim of carrying out a landscape analysis of health-related data infrastructures.

There is an option to select 'I don't know' under each question. However, we would encourage users to consider if there is someone else in their organisation who does know the answer to that question, to increase the accuracy of the assessment. You would need to share the FAIRness report within your organisation. At each updating step, a new csv file can be produced and used to generate an updated FAIRness report.

Step by step guide for users in myBinder/Rstudio:

1. Open and knit the FAIR_TOOL.rmd Rmd notebook
2. Input your answers for each question in the tool
3. Click 'Download' and save the csv file
4. Upload the csv file in the Rstudio environment
5. Check and edit if needed the path and name of the csv file in the rmd code (line 39)  
6. Re-knit the Rmd notebook
7. This creates a FAIRness report, including pie charts demonstrating the percentage scores for each principle as well as an overall score.
8. Upload and share the FAIRness "FAIR_TOOL.html" report.
